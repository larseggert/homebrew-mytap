# homebrew-mytap

![Travis status](https://travis-ci.org/larseggert/homebrew-mytap.svg?branch=master)

These formulæ provide software that I need, but didn't make it into the main
homebrew distribution, for some reason.

## How do I install these formulæ?
`brew install larseggert/homebrew-mytap/<formula>`

Or `brew tap larseggert/homebrew-mytap` and then `brew install <formula>`.
